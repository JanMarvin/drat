## Drat Repo for JanMarvin

Since I neither have enough time nor am I willing enough to bother with CRAN for
my builds, I am providing sources and Windows binaries for my sources on this
drat repo.

You can include it using

```{R}
drat::addRepo("JanMarvin")
```

Currently it contains `nlsur` and `readspss`.

Packages are known to build on MacOs too, but I do not own a Mac and since have
no way to provide Mac binaries.
