<h1 id="drat-repo-for-janmarvin">Drat Repo for JanMarvin</h1>
<p>Since I neither have enough time nor am I willing enough to bother with CRAN for my builds, I am providing ziped sources and binaries for Windows and Mac for my R-packages in this drat repo.</p>
<p>You can include it using</p>
<pre class="{r}"><code>drat::addRepo(&quot;JanMarvin&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Afterwards you can install simply using <code>install.packages()</code>.</p>
<p>Currently it contains <a href="https://github.com/JanMarvin/nlsur"><code>nlsur</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/JanMarvin/readspss"><code>readspss</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/JanMarvin/readsas"><code>readsas</code></a>, and <a href="https://github.com/sjewo/readstata13"><code>readstata13</code></a>.</p>
